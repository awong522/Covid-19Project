Hey!
Made a helpful Dashboard observing the statistics of each countries Covid-19 status using SQL queries. 

The Countries status is based on the percentage infected that can be obesered on an interactive map, as well as view the infection trendline for each Country. You can also take a look at the histogram of Continents and the total cases, deaths, and death percentage. I think the results look interesting and can be helpful for future Covid-19 cases.
